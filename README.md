## Machine Learning and AI Courses

**NOTE :**  Below listed resources(suggested by Yoshua Bengio) are taken from Discord Server Artificial Intelligence (invite link: https://discord.gg/9TVtVEZ) 

Here is a collection of some of my favorite FREE online courses on AI/ML:
1) The best and the most popular ML course is Andrew Ng's (Stanford) ML
course: https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
2) If you want to learn deep learning (preferably after you learn ML), here
are the two most popular courses:
    i) Andrew Ng's DL course (I recommend this one):
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning or
www.deeplearning.ai.
    ii) The quick but possibly harder and possibly more practical courses: 
www.fast.ai
3) If you want to learn artificial intelligence (AI) in general, here's a
course on AI taught by the guy who literally wrote the book on AI:
https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/cs271
4)  I recommend learning mathematics in college/university but if you don't
have time or unable or need a review,        i) here's a course:
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning
   ii) Mathematics for computer science pdf:
https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-042j-mathematics-for-computer-science-fall-2010/readings/MIT6_042JF10_notes.pdf
   iii) GRE math review (you should all know the math in this book, it's
basically high school level but it's a very good review if you forgot some
of it):  https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_math_review.pdf
5) More challenging  ML/AI courses, caution: Berkley's courses are graduate
level:
    i) Berkley's ML course: https://see.stanford.edu/course/cs229
    ii) Berkley's AI course: http://ai.berkeley.edu/home.html
    iii) Columbia's AI course:
https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:ColumbiaX+CSMM.101x+1T2018/course/

    iv) Geoffrey Hinton's Neural Networks course:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks/home/info
    v) Berkley's Deep Learning course (very good but very difficult):
http://cs231n.stanford.edu/


6) More ML (data science) courses:
    i) Python ML course:
https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python
    ii) TensorFlow crash course:
https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/
    iii) Python data analysis course:
https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-data-analysis
7) RL courses:     ( Guide: https://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/)
    i) Best RL lectures (somewhat easy but not as detailed as other RL
courses) (By the guy who made AlphaGo):
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7-jPKtc4r78-wCZcQn5IqyuWhBZ8fOxT
    ii) Berkley's RL course (difficult but very detailed):
https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/schedule.html
    iii) Udacity's RL course: (slightly less difficult than Berkley's
course, again, very detailed): https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud600
   iv) Berkley's Deep RL course (heavy on math):
http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/
    v) John Schulman Deep Renforcement Learning YouTube lectures:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aUrX-rP_ss4


8) Stanford NLP course: http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/syllabus.html
9) Other courses:
  i) MIT's course for self-driving cars (easy/fun course with lots of
famous guest speakers) :
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6INDaLcuJY&list=PLrAXtmErZgOeiKm4sgNOknGvNjby9efdf
  ii) MIT's Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) aka True AI course
(easy/fun course with lots of famous guest speakers) :
https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4

11) If you're wondering which college/university major is right for A.I. or
M.L., I think most experts will say that it is Computer Science. Getting a
double major (or a minor) in mathematics would also be very beneficial. If
you can't do this, I recommend taking a lot of extra mathematics courses as
a computer science major. The most important math topics for ML are
probably: Calculus, Statistics, Linear Algebra, and Discrete
Structures/Algebra (perhaps also Mathematical Statistics, Abstract Algebra,
Logic Theory, Set Theory, Probability Theory, Graph Theory, and so on).
Also good to note that since most of A.I. today is done on computers, you
need to make sure you become a good programmer, so I recommend studying
topics like algorithms, computer languages, operating systems (or any other
class where you can learn UNIX or Linux), and data structures. The basic
mathematics and programming courses (Calculus and below) can be found on
Khan Academy. The more advanced courses can be found on YouTube just by
searching the course name and adding "MIT" or some other famous university
name or from other individuals teaching the course and posting lectures on
YouTube.
